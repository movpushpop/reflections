What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

The metadata is necessary to identify the folder as a git repository and to allow 
for version control.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is not a directory as it does not actually hold files, it is a 
conceptual list of files that will be added to the repository with a commit.
The staging area allows someone to add and remove files before making a commit so
that everything can be in order and correct before the commit is done.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?

Just add the files relevant to the logical change to the staging area and commit
each logical change seperately.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history

to maintain the original source in its own seperate branch.

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in
the diagram the way we do?

What are the pros and cons of Gitâ€™s automatic merging vs. always doing merges
manually?
