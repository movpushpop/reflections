When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    A local machine can crash, causing you to lose work and your commit history.
    If it's remotely hosted this adds some redundancy.  Also a remote repository
    opens up the possibility of easy collaboration with others as well as working
    on the same project from different computers.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Automatic pulls wouldn't work out well if: A) you want to work with previous commits
    or if you're working with other people that could be changing things while you're
    working on something.  The best strategy is to pull changes only when you're sure
    you want to and ready to.
